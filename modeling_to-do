To do next

1. Temporal yield with weather variables--need to generate reliable drought severity index
3. All models with latent soil variables
4. Check for need for spatial error modeling?
5. Need for more explicit temporal model, like specific autoregressive model or temporal error structure?


Questions

1. What areas are vulnerable to yield variability and why

2. What's best way to do aggregation?
1a. CV
1b. MYP

3. If each county built up SOM by 4p1000, how much would yield variability go down?

4. If each county built up SOM by 4p1000 AND we increased extreme events, what would we expect for yield variability?

5. Combine with Dan's long-term trials yield variability analysis to uncover local-level mechanism with local-level data?
